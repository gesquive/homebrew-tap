# Homebrew Tap

This tap contains the latest formula for the following apps:
- [cig](https://github.com/gesquive/cig) - 
formats PEM certificates in a nice human readable (mkcert.org) format
- [rip](https://github.com/gesquive/rip) - 
sends a text file line by line to a remote host/port.


# Installing 

To install the tap, run:
```shell
$ brew tap gesquive/tap
```

After the tap is installed, you can install apps like any other brew formula:
```shell
$ brew install cig
```

# Removing

To uninstall, run:
```shell
$ brew untap gesquive/tap
```

Note: removing the tap will not remove any formulas installed from that tap.
